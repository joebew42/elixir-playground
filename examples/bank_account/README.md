# BankAccount

A simple project used to get more confidence with [Processes](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/processes.html) in Elixir.

We are supposed to write a simple program that allow us to manage bank accounts of our customers. For example we should be able to deposit money, withdrawal money and check our account balance.
