# DOING

# TODO

* rename "query" with a more significant name. Maybe we can call it "command", or "call", "action", or "execute", ...
* take care of the case the server don't reply (timeout)
* withdrawal money
* create a new account
* delete an account

# DONE

* add a catch-all handler for not handled messages
* think to group tests not by use cases but by starting conditions (ex. account does not exists ...)
* check current account balance
* deposit money
