# BankAccountOTP

The version of this example that using the processes can be found [here](../bank_account/).

A simple project used to get more confidence with [OTP](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/supervisor-and-application.html) in Elixir.

We are supposed to write a simple program that allows us to manage bank accounts of our customers. For example we should be able to deposit money, withdrawal money and check our account balance.

## Requirements

* Manage multiple `account`, one for each customer.
* For each account we can perform these actions:
  * create a new account
  * delete an account
  * check current balance
  * deposit money
  * withdrawal money
